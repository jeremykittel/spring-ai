Why should I consider using prompt templates?

Prompt templates are structured, pre-defined instructions that serve as a starting point for generating AI content.

These prompts help writers and content creators craft compelling and relevant material efficiently.

Tokenizer

OpenAI's large language models (sometimes called GPTs) process text using **tokens**, which are common sequences of
characters found in a text set.

This translates to money at the end of the day.

ALL credits expire. The initial free credit, three months after account creation. Then purchased ones after a year.
There’s no system to even observe that credits are ensured a first-in-first-out so that your expiring credits aren’t the
first used.

Lesson: buy credits in intervals like $40.01, $40.02 to identify them against further loss of context.

**All sales of Services, including sales of prepaid Services, are final. Service Credits are not refundable and**
**expire one year after the date of purchase or issuance if not used, unless otherwise specified at the time of purchase
**.
